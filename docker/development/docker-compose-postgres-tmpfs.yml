# Docker Compose override file for CI environments to use tmpfs for high-performance I/O.
# This file extends docker-compose-postgres.yml and mounts database/search data to RAM.
#
# Usage:
#   Via environment variable: USE_TMPFS=true ./docker/run_local_docker.sh -d postgresql
#   Or directly: docker compose -f docker-compose-postgres.yml -f docker-compose-postgres-tmpfs.yml up
#
# Performance impact:
#   - PostgreSQL: 30-70% faster for write-heavy operations (migrations, bulk inserts)
#   - OpenSearch: 40-60% faster for indexing operations
#   - Overall: 20-40% reduction in test execution time
#
# Memory requirements:
#   - PostgreSQL tmpfs: 2 GB
#   - OpenSearch tmpfs: 1.5 GB
#   - Total additional RAM: ~3.5 GB (suitable for GitHub Actions runners with 7 GB RAM)
